This is a ROS-based online learning framework for human classification in 3D LiDAR scans, taking advantage of robust multi-target tracking to avoid the need for data annotation by a human expert.
Please watch the videos below for more details.

# Install & Build
```bash
// Install prerequisite packages 
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-people
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-bfl
$ mkdir -p svm/src
$ cd svm/src
$ git clone https://github.com/DLu/wu_ros_tools.git

// The core 
$ git clone https://github.com/pat-CIMAR-UF/online_learning.git

// Build
$ cd catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

# Run
After catkin_make succeed, modify 'line 3' of online_learning/object3d_detector/launch/object3d_detector.launch, and make the value is the path where your bag files are located:

`<arg name="bag" value="/home/yq/Downloads/LCAS_20160523_1200_1218.bag"/>`

The bag file offered by [Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems](http://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk) is in velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan message type, so we would need related velodyne packages in ROS:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-velodyne*
```
Now, the svm should be able to run:
```bash
$ cd catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch object3d_detector object3d_detector.launch
```
